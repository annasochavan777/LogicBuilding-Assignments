There are a total of 12 case requirements. Out of these, we have received complete details for 7 requirements. For the remaining 5, we are expecting DP codes for 3 of them, and the other 2 require logic implementation in the message, which we won’t be able to complete in the current sprint. Additionally, we are adding 2 manual case requirements shared by Vincent. In summary, we won’t be able to complete only 2 case requirements as they require some logic to be implemented.
