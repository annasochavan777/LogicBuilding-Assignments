As discussed during yesterday's call, the following nine requirements have been finalized. Out of these, only the DP codes for two requirements are pending. Additionally, I wanted to confirm that the two requirements previously shared by Vincent are no longer needed, as this was discussed and agreed upon with GG and Vincent. Is my understanding correct?
